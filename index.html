        Hello My name is Calandra Miller. This is my website and I am here to tell you a little <br>
        about myself. Before I started my journey at DeVry University. I was a Medical Assistant. <br>
        I worked for allergy clinics for 3 years and just wasn't enjoying what I was doing, so I <br>
        decided to go a different route and stumbled across technology, I always loved technology <br>
        but never thought about making career out of it. One day I googled careers in the tech field <br>
        and came across Software Development. I did not know there were different options and found <br>
        I would love to design websites! So here I am creating one on my own. 
    </p>    
    <p>
        I am a current student and you are now viewing my about me page that will follow up with a <br>
        few all more information about myslef. For hobbies I love to go fishing I am a big animal lover <br>
        and a mother to an awesome 12 year old boy.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Website is also going to display everything I have learned over the past few weeks and <br>
         boy is it alot! There definitely were challenges along the way and stress but I was able <br>
         to over come it all and stay strong. I'm very close to the finish line of completing my <br>
         schooling, and I am excited to show what I've learned and accomplished! <strong>Enjoy!!!</strong>
